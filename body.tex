\section{Introduction}
Assessing a college coach can be hard. Traditionally, the assessment of a coach is entirely decided by the  performance of his team. This method, however, is not convincing enough in that it neglects the promotion a coach has brought to his team.

We, on the other hand, develop a model trying to combine these two aspects together by taking both these two elements, performance of the team and promotion brought by the coach, into consideration. Furthermore, we develop a method to evaluating the performance of a team with limited information, which makes the evaluation for coaches of the whole past century possible since data in those early years may not be as comprehensive as it is now.


Although a hitter might expect a model of the batCbaseball collision to
yield insight into how the bat breaks, how the bat imparts spin on the ball,
how best to swing the bat, and so on, we model only the sweet spot.


%=============================问题分析==========================================
\section{Analysis of the Problem }
Basically, our model assessments a coach based on the performance of teams. So a fundamental issue here is properly evaluates the performance of a team during a season. This issue, however, is related to several aspects which are intricately connected with each other. Our model develops a method to give a assessment of the performance for the team based on its Win-Loss percentage, its opponents' strength and the rank of conference it is in.

Based on a comprehensive evaluation of performance for all teams, the model get some parameters which can depict different aspects of a coach. These parameters are carefully selected such that they are independent of each other and each parameter is well related to an aspect of the coach. Besides, these parameters will make full use of our data found, which suggests the comprehensiveness of our model.

A series of preliminaries are set to filter coaches ahead of the model in order to minimize our size of candidates. These preliminaries are selected such that real "legends" will not be overlooked and will sure to be selected. This procedure will greatly alleviate our calculation, thus making more comprehensive and complicate model possible.

The model can be explained by \textbf{Figure 1}:
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{Overall framework}
\end{figure}

In the model, based primarily on records of NCAA teams for the last century, we synthesize the data into two parameters: performance and promotion.

Performance measures the team's performance during the time directed by the coach of interest. This parameter is similar to the traditional way of measurements. Promotion measures to what extent can the coach makes the team work better. As will showed later, these two parameter is based on data of different periods of a team, so they do depict different aspects of a coach.

\subsection{Basic definitions}

\subsubsection{Win-Loss percentage}
Since the model's purpose is to rank coaches in the past century, records must be carefully selected to enable the comparison between teams from different era. We select Win-Loss percentage(WLP) as one of its basic figures.
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
Given an interval of interest, suppose the team under consideration has $w$ wins, $l$ losses and $d$ ties. The Win-Loss percentage(WLP) is:
$$WLP \doteq \frac{w + 0.5d}{w + l + d}$$
\end{definition}
The selection is based on the following considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Win-Loss percentage for the sports we select is recorded or can be calculated throughout the whole past century.
\item Win-Loss percentage can minimize the influence brought by different tournament system and different rules, which provides the model with more generality.
\item For all teams, the Win-Loss percentage is of the same scale, which means $WLP\in [0,1]$.
\item The expectation for Win-Loss percentage is the same for all teams, which is 0.5. So this is a fair index when comparing performances across teams, avoiding prejudices brought by the model.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conference Strength}
Besides measurements for a single team, the model also considers the strength a team is in. This parameter depicts the overall performance of teams in a conference and is used for comparing teams from different conferences.
\begin{definition}
Given an interval and a conference with N teams of interest. Suppose for a team $t_i$ in the conference, it has $W_i$ overall wins, $L_i$ overall losses and $D_i$ overall ties. Meanwhile, it has $w_i$ conference wins, $l_i$ conference losses and $d_i$ conference ties. Then we have \textbf{Conference Strength} p is
$$p \doteq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(W_i + 0.5D_i - w_i - 0.5d_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^N(W_i+L_i+D_i-w_i-l_i-d_i)}$$
\end{definition}
Here overall wins(losses, ties) means all games, whether the opponents are from the same conference or not, is taken into consideration, and conference wins(losses, ties) only considers those games with opponents in the conference.

Note that it is similar to the definition of WLP, so this parameter has similar properties as WLP:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conference Strength for the sports we select can be calculated throughout the whole past century.
\item Conference Strength is related to the overall performance of teams in a conference, and does not necessarily related to tournament system and rules, which provides the model with more generality.
\item For all conferences, Conference Strength is of the same scale, which means $p\in [0,1]$.
\item The expectation for Conference Strength is the same for all conferences, which is 0.5. So this is a fair index when comparing performances across conferences, avoiding prejudices brought by the model.
\end{itemize}

%==================================模型建立==============================================

\subsection{Measurement for Performance}
In this part, we will explain the system to measure a team's performance. This index will serves as a basic part for evaluating promotion and stability.

\newcommand{\performance}{x_i\frac{1+b(p-0.5)}{1+a\sigma}}
\begin{definition}
In a season of interest, suppose there are N teams in a conference $t_1, t_2,\dots,t_N$. Team $t_i$ has a WLP $x_i$. The conference has a Conference Strength p. Then the performance for team $t_i$ is
$$y_i\doteq \performance$$
\end{definition}

Here $\mu$ is the average and $\sigma$ is the variance, that is $\sigma = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$ and $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i}}{N}$.

In the definition, $a$ and $b$ are both parameters and are both relatively small.In fact, here $a$ depicts the influence of the teams opponents and $b$ depicts the influence of the conference.

The definition of $y_i$ has the following properties:

\newtheorem{property}{Property}

\begin{property}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{x_i}} > 0$$
\end{property}
\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{x_i}} = \frac{1+b(p-0.5)}{1+a\sigma}$$
Since both $a$ and $b$ are positive, we have $\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{x_i}}>0$.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\begin{property}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{\sigma}}<0$$
\end{property}
\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{\sigma}} = -x_i\frac{1+b(p-0.5)}{1+a\sigma}\ln(1+a\sigma)$$
Similarly, we have both $a$ and $b$ are positive, so $\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{\sigma}}<0$
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\begin{property}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{p}} > 0$$
\end{property}
\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
$$\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{\p}} = \frac{b}{1+a\sigma}x_i > 0$$
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

These three properties are easy to prove.

These three properties suggests how performance is related to three variables, which is quite intuitive. Specifically, since $p=0.5$ means the conference is of middle level among all conferences, there is a $(p-0.5)$ inside the definition to be consistent with the property.

Next we have \textbf{Property 4}, which will guarantee the comparable between different teams from different conferences or/and different eras.
\begin{property}
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{y_i}}{N}<\frac{1-b}{2(1+a)}$$
\end{property}

To prove \textbf{Property 4}, first we prove the following claim:
\newtheorem{claim}{Claim}

\begin{claim}
In a tournament with N teams $t_1,t_2,\dots,t_N$, team $t_i$ has a WLP $x_i$, then
$$\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i} = \frac{N}{2}$$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
Each team plays the same number of games, which is $2N\choose 2=N(N-1)$, suppose team $t_i$ has $w_i$ wins and $d_i$ ties. Then
$$x_i=\frac{w_i + 0.5t_i}{N(N-1)}$$
so
$$\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(w_i + 0.5t_i)}{N(N-1)}$$
Since each game is counted either as a win and a loss or as two ties, we have
$$\sum_{i=1}^N(w_i+0.5t_i)=\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$$
so we have
$$\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i} = \frac{N}{2}$$
\end{proof}

Then we can prove \textbf{Property 4}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i &= \frac{1+b(p-0.5)}{1+a\sigma}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i\\
&=\frac{1+b(p-0.5)}{1+a\sigma}\frac{1}{2}\\
&<\frac{1-b}{2(1+a)}
\end{align}
\end{proof}

\textbf{Property 4} suggests this measurement is consistent among all conferences and all eras. The expectation of $y_i$ is close to 0.5 given that $a$ and $b$ are both small. So $\sigma$ and $p$ will not bring into the model too much prejudices but only minor amendments.

\textbf{Comparison with SRS}

Here we compare our measurements with another system of performance measurement called simple ranking system(SRS), which is used for ranking college basketball teams recently in National Collegiate Athletic Association(NCAA).

SRS is aimed at involving opponent's performance into a single team's assessment and finally make reliable predictions about which team will get the most credits in the conference. Different from our model, SRS builds its evaluation on a set of equations
\begin{align}
\nonumber
&R_1 = x_1 - \mu + \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j\neq i} R_j\\\nonumber
&R_2 = x_2 - \mu + \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j\neq i} R_j\\\nonumber
&...\\\nonumber
&R_N = x_N - \mu + \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j\neq i} R_N \\\nonumber
\end{align}
where $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i}{N}$

This set of equations can be solved with Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Obviously, there are two parts in each equation. The first one is $x_i - \mu$, which stands for credits got by the team. Another part is  $\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j\neq i} R_j$, which can be seen as an amendment brought by its opponents.

This method, however, cannot achieve its initial purpose. Further study shows that this set of equations has a solution set like
$$R_i = \frac{N-1}{N}x_i + c$$
where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.

So what we got from this method only relies on N and $x_i$, instead of $x_1, x_2,\dots,x_N$ as we wished. In contrast, our model do take every team's WLP into consideration, which suggests this method can partly shows the relationships among different teams inside the conference.

Also, our measurement takes into account the overall performance of the conference while SRS does not. So SRS cannot be applied to compare teams from different conferences.

\subsection{Measure of Promotion}
In this part, the promotion a coach has brought to his team is calculated. This calculation is based on the team's performance data described in previous section.

The promotion is determined by two parts of data. One is the team's \emph{historical performance}, which means how this team works before the coach came to the team and another is the team's \emph{temporary performance}, which shows how the team works during the period directed by the coach. The model makes a prediction based on the historical performance and compares the prediction with its real performance. The result of the comparison will be used as promotion.

\begin{definition}
Suppose we have a team's historical performance $y_1, y_2,\dots, y_s$ and its temporary performance $y_{s+1}, y_{s+2},\dots, y_r$. Then the promotion is
$$p\doteq \frac{\sum_{i = s+1}^ry_i}{r-s} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^sy_i}{s}$$
\end{definition}

This definition of promotion is straightforward. The difference between expectation and real performance can be regarded as promotion.

Besides, when calculating promotions, more data is used in the model, which suggests the model is more comprehensive. Since data we can use is limited because of the long time interval, take full use of data can be an advantage of our model.

\subsection{Measure of Stability}
With the measurement of performance, we can further estimate the stability of a team. This can be depicted by variance of performance during a period of time.
